# In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

# A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

# Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 2, y = 1
# Output: 1

# Explanation: [0, 0] â†’ [2, 1]
# Example 2:

# Input: x = 5, y = 5
# Output: 4
